# Regression-Analysis-of-Co2-Emission-for-Various-Car-Models
This project was created for IBM coursework: Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction.
- Implemented Simple Linear Regression Model to interpret the relation between engine size and co2 emission.
- Calculated the accuracy of the regression model using MSE evaluation metrics.
- Made extensive use of Python libraries: pandas, matblotlib and scikit-learn for data exploration, visualization and ML.
